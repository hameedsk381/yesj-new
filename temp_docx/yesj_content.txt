Section 1: Welcome Message
Headline: "Where Every Youth Shouts YES to Their Dreams"
Subheadline: A Movement of Hope, A Ministry of Transformation
Body Copy: In the heart of India's Telugu states, where 85 million people call home, countless young dreamers face walls too high to climb alone. Poverty. Discrimination. Limited English. Broken education systems. These aren't just statistics. They're stolen futures.
But here's what we believe: Every young person, regardless of caste, religion, economic background, or past circumstances, carries infinite potential. They don't need charity. They need a launchpad.
That's YESJ.
Since 2015, we've been more than a program. We've been a revolution. A Jesuit-rooted movement that walks alongside youth from rural villages to urban slums, transforming "I can't" into "I CAN" and "I WILL."

Headline: "A Jesuit Mission Born from Radical Love"
Subheadline: Reimagining youth empowerment in the Telugu heartland since 2015

Our Story Section
In the Telugu-speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, home to nearly 85 million people, countless young lives encounter harsh realities daily—poverty, lack of education, unemployment, casteism, gender discrimination, and social inequality. In rural, semi-urban, and urban slum areas, millions of youths watch their dreams, hopes, and creative energies destroyed by circumstances beyond their control.
The poverty is not self-incurred. These sections of society have been pushed to the margins. Youth dropping out of school at tender ages to work as child labor, teenagers abandoning high school to toil as cheap labor where their blood and sweat are exploited, girl children married young instead of educated—these are the intersectional injustices we confront daily.
But YESJ is convinced to spread a YES in the lives of youth by giving a helping hand to dream and realize their dreams.
Since 2015, we've been a beacon of light and a ray of hope for those who are last, lost, and least, those who lack resources and guidance for a better life. We walk alongside young people, regardless of their educational, social, religious, and economic backgrounds, unlashing their potential to lead meaningful and fulfilling lives.
The YES Philosophy:
We believe that instilling hope and courage in young people and creating a support system will empower them to shout to the world:
YES – I have Dreams.
YES – I am capable of fulfilling my Dreams.
YES – I Can and I Will be the Dream I want to be if only I am given an opportunity.

1. PURPOSE

Our purpose is to assist in building a just world by transforming the lives of young people.

2. PROCESS

With the right resources, support, and training, people can be enabled to solve their own problems. Rather than random and impulsive approaches, we follow a long-term systematic approach with spiritual, social, psychological, contextual, intellectual, and creative integration.
We follow the praxis of:
Experience → Reflection → Involvement → Transformation
We firmly believe in collaborating with other individuals and organizations who share our values, building networks that multiply impact.

Program Sections

1. SUMMER SHAPES (SS) 
Tagline: "Break the English Barrier. Unlock Your Future."
English is no longer just a language in India - it opens a world of opportunities. Especially for marginalized communities, English language is proved to be a weapon to break their chains and be the leaders of tomorrow. In this cyber age where English is the deciding factor to get employed, sadly many young people have no access to quality English education. Even when taught, the methodology followed has been highly ineffective, leaving youth unable to form sentences. In addition, poor soft skills bar their socialization, adaptability, and problem-solving capacities.
Through this initiative, rural and disadvantaged youth gain access to free 30-day residential training in English Communicative Skills along with soft and life skills, which increases their self-confidence and self-esteem for greater life.
Program Highlights:
Residential immersion in English-only environment
Communicative focus, not just grammar
Personality development and grooming
Public speaking and interview skills
Zero cost with food and lodging provided
Impact: 40+ batches completed | 1,200+ graduates | 90% confidence boost | 75% improved employment prospects

CTA: "Apply Now" | "Download Brochure" | "Watch Testimonials"


2. MULTI-SKILL TRAINING (MuST) 
Tagline: "From Dropout to Dignified Employment"
Through MuST we work to enable, equip, and enhance the capacity of dropouts and unorganized youth to undertake self-employment as well as access employment with stable salary through skill training programs. We actively collaborate with governmental, non-governmental, and corporate institutions to provide vocational skill training to help youth stand on their legs for a decent salary enough to raise a family.
YESJ conducts residential training at regular intervals, bringing youth from rural and suburban areas, and strives hard to get them jobs and a big YES in their lives.

CTA: "Apply Now"

3. SCHOLAR SUPPORT PROGRAMME (SSP) 
Tagline: "Where Brilliance Meets Opportunity"
SSP is aimed to accompany and financially support college-going students who are academically bright and financially poor, enabling them to pursue their desired tertiary education and fulfill their professional dreams.
Beyond tuition fees, we provide comprehensive support including books, examination fees, living expenses, academic mentoring, career counseling, psychological support, and leadership development. Our holistic approach ensures not just degree completion but complete personal and professional readiness.
Selection Process: Rigorous merit-based assessment through written tests, oral interviews, and comprehensive evaluation ensuring we support the most deserving students.
Impact: 100% college completion rate | Full scholarship support for 4+ years | Lifelong mentorship and career guidance
CTA: "Apply for Scholarship" | "Support a Scholar"

4. PERSONALITY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMMES (PEP) 
Tagline: "Say YES to Leadership"
Through PEP, tailor-made orientations, courses, seminars, and workshops are conducted in the areas of soft skills, life skills, personality development, etc., to help youth gain confidence to face the complexities of life and live a life of joy, meaning, and purpose. Thousands of students are trained so far to say YES to lead.
YESJ further equips them with an integrated approach to personal development, self-help, awareness, organization, program design and implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of parish/rural development programs. This comprehensive training enables them to become more effective in their roles and better equipped to bring about positive change in their communities.
Delivery: Customizable one-day or multi-day workshops conducted at schools, colleges, and parishes with food provided. Free of cost for institutions.
Annual Reach: 25+ programs | 5,000+ participants | Immediate confidence boost in 85% participants
CTA: "Request PEP for Your Institution" | "View Schedule"


5. MAGIC YOUTH 
Tagline: "Men & Women Aiming at Greater Initiatives for Change"
The Student Youth Wing of YESJ is a formal organization established in educational institutions to provide young people with the opportunity to become individuals of conscience, competence, compassion, and commitment, and to become agents of change for themselves and their communities.
The leadership team and group are managed by student volunteers, with support from staff and management. All programs, activities, and initiatives are designed to educate, empower, and raise awareness among the youth.
They transform campus communities and neighborhoods through implementable praxis of 'Experience – Reflection – Involvement – Transformation' to aim at long-term sustainable approaches, wholistic development, and consistent follow-up to design programmes that instill life skills, social skills, personality skills, faith formation, leadership, and address social anomalies.
CTA: "Start MAGIC in Your Institution" | "Join a Chapter"


6. EACH ONE – TEACH TEN (EOTT) 
Tagline: "Pay Back to Society"
YESJ's Social Enterprise aims at improving literacy and numeracy skills. We set up centres of learning and tutoring in slums, rural and suburban areas with the help of local parishes, schools, colleges, and governmental bodies. With a motif to 'pay back to society', our Ignitors create a loving atmosphere for learning, making them read, lead, and thereby succeed in life. We also help the educated young support themselves for their stationery costs.
The potential of youth is high, but resources are meager. In this competitive world, one with resources comes out with flying colors. YESJ doesn't want the young to stop themselves dreaming high just because of their financial or social circumstances.
Dual Impact: Children receive free tutoring | Educated youth gain teaching experience and stipend
CTA: "Become an Ignitor" | "Start a Learning Center"


7. JoY (JOBS FOR YOUTH) DESK 
Tagline: "Connecting Talent with Opportunity"
Having potential is not enough; reaching out to the best possible opportunities is important. Especially in the case of jobs, the opportunities are wide, but the huge population makes it difficult to get on a common channel. Thus, individuals are not well-informed about resources and available jobs. They end up settling for less-paid jobs where their skills are not utilized to their best.
This program aims to identify struggling unemployed youth, trains and guides them to secure employment through referrals, recommendations, and JoY Melas (job fairs).
Services: Job matching | Resume building | Interview preparation | Career counseling | Quarterly job fairs
CTA: "Register with JoY Desk" | "View Job Openings"


8. ORGANIZING GOD ORIENTED DAYS (O GOD) ✝️
Tagline: "Strengthening Faith, Building Relationship"
The days are designed to help participants build a personal relationship with God and strengthen their faith so they can become true Children of God. A variety of methods such as studying Scripture, praying and meditating, inter-religious dialogues, messages, and visits are used to enrich their faith.
CTA: "Attend Next O GOD Program"


9. YESJ YUVOTSAVAALU (YY) 
Tagline: "YESJ YOUTH CAN!"
This is an annual/biannual event of Youth Festival Celebration. Youth take active part in great numbers. They aim at strengthening the Andhra Province Youth Congress. They offer youth a comprehensive platform and foreground to gain distinctive identity to collectively 'Express, Experience, and Enrich to Construct an ever-widening collective vision' to fight against and build a vibrant and just world which says 'YESJ YOUTH CAN'.
CTA: "Register for Yuvotsavaalu" | "View Past Celebrations"


10. VOLUNTARY IMMERSION PROGRAMME (VIP) 🌍

STORY 1: LAKSHMI'S VOICE
Featured Image: Professional photo of Lakshmi in office attire, confident smile
Program: Summer Shapes, 2023
Age: 22
Hometown: Small village in Guntur district, AP
Challenge: Could not speak English, limited job prospects
Her Story:
[Opening quote in large typography]
"In my village, English was not a language—it was a wall. A wall that kept people like me out of opportunities, out of cities, out of dreams."
Lakshmi grew up in a family of agricultural laborers. The eldest of four siblings, she completed her B.Com from a Telugu-medium college but couldn't find work beyond local shops paying ₹5,000/month.
"I applied to 30 companies in Hyderabad. Every interview ended the same: 'Your English is not sufficient.' I felt ashamed. Defeated. Like I was born with less value."
A friend told her about Summer Shapes. Lakshmi was skeptical—30 days could change a life?
The YESJ Experience:
"The first week was terrifying. I couldn't even introduce myself without my voice shaking. But the teachers didn't judge. They celebrated every word I spoke, no matter how broken."
Daily immersion in English-only environment, supportive peer community, and personality grooming sessions slowly cracked the wall.
"By week three, I presented a five-minute speech in English. I cried afterward—not from fear, but pride."
The Transformation:
Today, Lakshmi is a customer care executive at a tech company in Hyderabad, earning ₹18,000/month.
"I'm not just supporting my family—I'm funding my younger sister's education so she never faces what I did. Summer Shapes didn't just teach English; it taught me I deserve to dream big."
Impact Metrics:
Income increase: 260%
Confidence score: 9/10 (from 3/10)
Family impact: Supporting 6 members

STORY 2: RAVI KUMAR'S FIRE
Featured Image: Ravi in welding gear, sparks flying, intense focus
Program: MuST - Industrial Welding, 2022
Age: 19
Hometown: Suburb of Visakhapatnam, AP
Challenge: School dropout, daily wage labor trap
His Story:
Ravi dropped out after Class 10. His father's illness meant Ravi needed to earn immediately. He worked construction sites for ₹300/day—backbreaking labor with no future.
"I watched my classmates go to college while I mixed cement. Society wrote me off as another dropout. I started believing them."
At 18, a YESJ volunteer visited his parish. Ravi learned about MuST welding training—completely free, residential, with job placement support.
The YESJ Experience:
"I'd never held a welding torch. The first time I struck an arc, I was terrified and exhilarated. For the first time, I was learning something skilled, something respected."
Three months of intensive training, safety protocols, blueprint reading, and hands-on practice. Ravi thrived.
"The trainers believed in me more than I believed in myself. They saw potential where I saw only poverty."
The Transformation:
Ravi now works at a fabrication company earning ₹25,000/month—more than his father earned in his healthiest years.
"I'm building my family's first pucca house. My younger brother will finish school because I can afford it now. YESJ didn't give me charity; they gave me dignity through skill."
Impact Metrics:
Income increase: 533%
Family home: Under construction
Siblings supported: 2

STORY 3: SRINIVAS' SCHOLARLY DREAM
Featured Image: Srinivas in engineering college, holding books, university campus background
Program: Scholar Support Program (SSP), 2021-Present
Age: 20
Hometown: Rural Telangana
Challenge: Brilliant student, zero resources for college
His Story:
Srinivas scored 95% in his Class 12 board exams. He ranked in top 1% of state engineering entrance exam. But his parents—daily wage agricultural workers—couldn't afford ₹2 lakhs/year for B.Tech.
"I watched my admission deadline pass. The day I should've been starting college, I was working in the fields. That was my reality."
A teacher who believed in him connected Srinivas to YESJ. The SSP selection process was rigorous—written test, interview, assessment. Srinivas excelled.
The YESJ Experience:
"SSP didn't just pay my fees. They assigned me a mentor, checked in monthly, provided books, even emotional support when I struggled with imposter syndrome."
Regular academic mentoring, professional skill workshops, summer internship facilitation, and career counseling accompanied the financial support.
"They treated education as holistic formation, not just degree completion."
The Transformation:
Srinivas is now in his 3rd year of B.Tech (Computer Science), maintaining 8.5 CGPA, top 5% of his class. He secured a summer internship at a major tech company.
"My parents cried when I got placed for summer internship at ₹25,000/month stipend. They couldn't believe their son—a field laborer's son—was working at a tech company."
Post-graduation, Srinivas plans to join civil services to reform rural education.
"SSP proved that talent is evenly distributed but opportunity is not. I want to be part of changing that."
Impact Metrics:
Academic CGPA: 8.5/10
Summer internship: Secured
Future goal: Civil services

STORY 4: PRIYA'S EMPOWERMENT
Featured Image: Priya working at her tailoring shop, smiling, surrounded by fabrics
Program: MuST - Tailoring, 2021
Age: 24
Hometown: Semi-urban Andhra Pradesh
Challenge: Early marriage, no education, economic dependence
Her Story:
Priya was married at 17. Dropped out of school at Class 8. For six years, she was economically dependent on her husband, with two young children.
"I loved my family, but I felt invisible. I had no income, no voice in financial decisions, no identity beyond 'mother' and 'wife.'"
A neighbor told her about YESJ tailoring training. Her husband initially resisted—"Who will manage home for 3 months?"
"My mother-in-law supported me. She said, 'Let her learn something for herself.'"
The YESJ Experience:
"I'd never touched a sewing machine. Learning was hard—I was older than other students, hadn't been in classroom for years. But the teachers were patient."
Three months of intensive training: machine sewing, pattern making, garment construction, small business management.
"They didn't just teach stitching. They taught us how to price our work, handle customers, manage finances."
The Transformation:
Priya now runs her own tailoring business from home, earning ₹15,000-20,000/month.
"I bought my own sewing machine with my first earnings. My children saw me succeed through hard work. My husband respects my contribution to family income now."
She employs two other women from her neighborhood, mentoring them.
"YESJ transformed me from dependent to entrepreneur. I'm not just earning—I'm empowering."
Impact Metrics:
Monthly income: ₹15,000-20,000
Women employed: 2
Household impact: Major contributor

Program: Voluntary Immersion Programme (VIP), 2023
Age: 25
Hometown: London, UK
Experience: 3-month immersion
His Story:
David, a postgraduate student from UK, wanted to experience "real India" beyond tourist circuits.
"I Googled 'meaningful volunteering India' and found YESJ. Their philosophy attracted me—not 'save poor people' but 'journey with youth.'"
The YESJ Experience:
Placed as English teacher at EOTT learning center in rural AP village.
"First week was culturally overwhelming. Language barrier, food adjustment, different pace of life. But the children's enthusiasm was infectious."
Taught basic English to 40 children aged 6-14, supported Summer Shapes program, participated in community development.
"I went thinking I'd teach. Instead, the community taught me—about resilience, joy with less, strong family bonds, hospitality."
The Transformation:
"I arrived with Western savior complex. I left humbled and grateful. These children didn't need 'saving'—they needed opportunities. YESJ creates those opportunities without destroying dignity."
David now fundraises for YESJ in UK, connected his university for partnership.
"VIP changed my career path. I'm pursuing international development with focus on education equity. My 3 months in that village showed me my life's work."
Impact Metrics:
Children taught: 40
Funds raised post-return: £5,000
Career redirected: Yes
